########## Stage 1: Builder (compile TypeScript → dist) ##########
FROM node:22-alpine AS builder

RUN apk add --no-cache libc6-compat

# Development environment for building
ENV NODE_ENV=development

# Copy npm manifests first for better layer caching
COPY package*.json ./

# Install all dependencies including devDependencies (for build tools)
RUN npm ci

# Build NestJS (TypeScript → dist)
RUN npm run build


########## Stage 2: Runner (production) ##########
FROM node:22-alpine AS runner

# Production environment
ENV NODE_ENV=production

# Install basic system libraries (same as builder if needed by runtime deps)
RUN apk add --no-cache libc6-compat

# Set working directory

# Copy only npm manifests

# Install production dependencies only (no devDependencies)
